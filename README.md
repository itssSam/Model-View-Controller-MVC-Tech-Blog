# Model-View-Controller-MVC-Tech-Blog

## Description 
This CMS-style blog site provides a platform for developers to share their expertise, discuss new technologies, and express their thoughts on the ever-evolving landscape of software development. It is built with the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architectural pattern and leverages Handlebars.js for dynamic content templating. The site's data persistence is managed by Sequelize, an ORM for Node.js, which interacts with a MySQL database to store user information, blog posts, and comments.
